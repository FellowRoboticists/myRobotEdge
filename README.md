myRobotEdge Arduino Sketch
==========================

This sketch teaches the robot to stay within an area delimited by low(er)
reflectance. For example, you can set the robot down on a white piece of poster
board on a surface with less reflectance (like carpet), and the robot will
attempt to stay within the bounds of the poster board.

You will note that some of the code here looks like some of the library code we've
got in the other repositories. They are not the same. The edge sketch is a 
relatively small subset of the actual full libraries.
